# BAMAZON
Bamazon is a Node JS app that uses MySQL as the database that drives inventory of an Amazon-like store.

How it works:
1. The user is shown the products available to order.
2. After the products are displayed the user is prompted to choose the id of the item they would like to buy.
3. After an id is given the user is then asked the quantity of the product they would like to buy.
4. The quantity inserted by the user and is then checked against the quantity available in stock. If quantity is not available, the user is given notice and given the opportunity to order again or quit the user interface.
5. If the order proceeds with quantity checked as sufficient the user is then given the total price for the order.
